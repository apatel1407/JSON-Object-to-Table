### JSON data chosen
In this section, mention which of the four JSON data sets you chose to use in your web page.

1. For these assignment, I choosed data-weather.js JSON data file.


### Brief description of web page developed (~150 words)
Describe your web page here. In your description, focus on how it works - and what the TA should do to test your web page's functionality. If you had to make any assumptions, write your assumptions here as well (if it goes over 150 words, it is okay).

Ans: My webpage is divided into two parts. They are as follows-
    1. The search section = For the search section, there is a usage of a "Form" element in the html file. The form element consist of textbox to enter a data and a button to search the entered data. The searching and sorting of dat is done javascript file under the function named search(). The search function loops through the table to search for the word specified by the user. For example: If a user enters "Q" or "Qr" than the words associated with it are sorted out and displayed in the division provided below the form element.

    2. The table section = For the table section, division is used to display the table in the webpage. In the javascript file, the headings for the table are displayed at first as they are unique for a row. After that there is for loop provided which helps in looping through the Json data and displaying the appropriate data below there headings.

    To test the webpage, a user can enter a word in the text-box and click on the search button. On clicking the search button, the required rows are displayed in the division. 

    Assumptions made:
    1. For desktop view and Mobile view: Made assumptions for the color properties and text properties for the form and the table to make them look creative. The assumptions are made to make the design to help users recognize the buttons, tables and forms.
